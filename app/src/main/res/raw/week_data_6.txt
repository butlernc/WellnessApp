Remember, protein is a group of amino acids.  Animal sources of protein are more complete proteins and contain more essential amino acids than plant protein.  Fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds also lack one or more essential amino acid.  Check out CDC\u2019s information on protein (link 1). The research continues to be controversial regarding red meats (link 2 & 3), but the quality of red meat certainly impacts the health benefits/risks.  For example, grass-fed, organic beef is rich in beneficial fatty acids that are missing from factory-raised cattle.  It is also cleaner, healthier, more flavorful, and richer in other nutrients.  Besides grass-fed beef, pastured chicken, wild salmon, tuna, pastured eggs, Greek yogurt, shellfish, whey protein isolate, and liver are among the highest quality protein sources.  Again, some of these foods are tough for those of us with limited resources, so focus on the best protein sources we have access to such as eggs, tuna, yogurt, nuts, nut butters, and seeds and keep the rest of the list in your back pocket for future reference!","physical_activity_description":"Core strengthening is much more than simply \u201cwanting six-pack abs.\u201d  That can be a result of core work, but certainly not the most important.  Our core is the center of all movement.  Therefore, a weak or inflexible core can affect how well our entire body moves.  Core muscles are comprised of the transverse and rectus abdominis, which is just below your sternum to your waist.  These muscles help us perform every day activities from mopping to playing tennis.  Some of our back muscles can also be considered core muscles.  These include the lower back and outer-middle back or our \u201clats\u201d.  Strong back muscles are also important as they help support our abs, help us maintain good posture, bend over, and lift things.  We can\u2019t forget about our side core muscles, also known as the obliques.  These important core muscles help you twist and bend from side to side.  Strengthening all of these muscles will greatly improve your ability to lift heavy things, but also assist with the rest of your core movements (link 1). Lastly, developing a strong and balanced group of core muscles will keep you injury free and feeling healthy and strong throughout your lifetime (link 2).","week":"6"}
