It can also help prevent heart disease and stroke, control blood pressure, prevent some types of cancers, avoid gastrointestinal disorders, and even protect against vision loss, according to the Harvard School of Public Health Nutrition Source.  But remember, variety is just as important as quantity.  Here are a few tips for increasing fruits and vegetables into your day: \u2022Keep fruit out where you can see it. That way you\u2019ll be more likely to eat it. Keep it out on the counter or in the front of the fridge. \u2022Get some every meal, every day. Try filling half your plate with vegetables or fruit at each meal. Try adding a salad to meals.  Stir fries are also easy and include lots of veggies.  Bonus points if you can get some fruits and vegetables at snack time, too. \u2022Explore the produce aisle and choose something new. Variety is the key to a healthy diet. Get out of a rut and try some new fruits and vegetables\u2014include dark green leafy vegetables, yellow, orange, and red fruits and vegetables, cooked tomatoes, and citrus fruits. \u2022Bag the potatoes. Choose other vegetables that are packed with more nutrients and more slowly digested carbs.

Resistance exercises can be done at home, outside, or in the gym.  It can involve weight machines, free weights, or calisthenics (body weight movements such as push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups).  It does not have to be complicated.  The McKinley Health Center at the University of Illinois has developed an easy-to-follow basic plan for designing a resistance training program.  Check it out here: (link 1). The title of this article summarizes it beautifully: \u201cresistance training is medicine\u201d (Westcott, 2012).  Benefits of resistance training include much more than improved physical performance and strength.  It may help prevent diabetes, enhance cardiovascular health, reduce blood pressure, decrease cholesterol, promote bone development, and much more (link 2).  To learn more about how to do resistance training at the gym, contact the staff at Crest Wellness Center or McPhee Strength and Performance Center(link 3).Always consult a physician before starting an exercise plan.
