Link 1 points out that we get some fluids through foods such as broth, soups, vegetables and fruits, but most water needs are met through drinking fluids.  Water helps our bodies regulate temperature, protect and cushion our joints, spinal cord, and other tissues, and also helps us get rid of wastes.  We need to drink water every day, even if we aren\u2019t exercising.  Of course, with vigorous activity it is important to drink even more.  The Mayo Clinic and Institute of Medicine recommend an adequate intake for men is about 3 liters (13 cups) and for women 2.2 liters (about 9 cups) of total beverages (link 2). Here are a few tips for increasing your water intake: Carry a water bottle for easy access when you are at school or work. Freeze some freezer-safe water bottles. Take one with you for ice-cold water all day long. Choose water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages. This tip can also help with weight management. Substituting water for one 20-ounce sugar-sweetened soda will save you about 240 calories. Choose water instead of other beverages when eating out. Generally, you will save money and reduce calories. Give your water a little pizzazz by adding a wedge of lime or lemon. This may improve the taste, and you just might drink more water than you usually do.","physical_activity_description":"Dr. Myers and the AHA point out that some of the benefits of regular cardiovascular exercise include reduction in body weight, blood pressure, bad cholesterol and increases in good cholesterol and insulin sensitivity.  Every adult should participate in 30 minutes or more of moderate activity on most days of the week.  Moderate activities include brisk walking, recreational activities such as cycling or swimming, house work or yard work.  Getting at least 30 minutes of exercise doesn\u2019t require a gym membership or fancy equipment.  Get outside, grab your friends, and just get moving.
