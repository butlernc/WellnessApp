Sugar, sugar, sugar, it is everywhere and often in hidden forms.  As researcher Chris Kresser (link 1) explains, excess refined sugar isn\u2019t good for us.  It can lead to weight gain, elevated cholesterol, insulin resistance, and cancer growth.  Additionally, research has also shown sugar to interfere with normal hormone signaling from ghrelin and leptin, which control appetite and satiety.  In other words, sugary foods will not make you feel full or satisfied and can easily lead to overconsumption.  In reality, small amounts of sugar can fit into a healthy whole foods diet, but we must learn to recognize it and avoid it.  Our bodies do not need added sugar. The Health Source reports the average American consumes 22 teaspoons of added sugar a day, which amounts to an extra 350 calories. While we sometimes add sugar to food ourselves, most added sugar comes from processed and prepared foods.  Sugar-sweetened beverages and breakfast cereals are two of the most serious offenders (link 2). So this week, swap that sugary drink for water and the sweetened breakfast cereal for old-fashioned oatmeal and fruit and to learn more check out this very informative article:  http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/added-sugar-in-the-diet/. ","physical_activity_description":"High intensity interval training (HIIT) is becoming the latest craze among all types of exercisers.  It has been a staple among athletic training for years.  HIIT can occur in the form of sprints, shuttle runs, timed laps in the pool, or any circuit type workout.  But does it work? Research is saying yes.  So how do you incorporate HIIT into your workout routine? It can be as simple as 30 Seconds Brisk Walk, 30 Seconds Sprint, repeat 7 more times for a total of 8 minutes. Or pick any combination of exercises (body weight, dumbbells, machines, or anything else you enjoy) and do a Tabata style workout- 20 second on, 10 seconds rest x 8 rounds. Check out this NPR article on interval training: (link 1) From HIIT to walking - they may seem extreme opposites, but the benefits are equally important! Many of the modern health and fitness experts are encouraging people to move more frequently as the risks of excessive sitting are becoming more and more apparent in our society.  We need to walk and walk often.  The numerous benefits of walking include improvements in glycemic control (especially if you walk after meals), lower blood pressure, stress reduction, benefits to mental health, and it even boosts immune function.  Being outside and connected to nature can increase these benefits.  Many of us are probably thinking we get plenty of walking from class to class around campus, which is great, but try adding a 10-20 minute walk through Putnam Park.
