(link 1)To keep within this limit, it is important to understand how an alcohol drink is measured. One drink is defined as 12 fluid ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol), 5 fluid ounces of wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 fluid ounces of 80 proof (40% alcohol) distilled spirits. One drink contains 0.6 fluid ounces of alcohol.Risks associated with drinking outside of low-risk/moderate limits include liver disease, high blood pressure, stroke, type 2 diabetes, several types of cancers, and impairment of both short and long term cognitive function. Excessive drinking is responsible for an average of 79000 deaths in the US each year, and is associated with a wide range of other health and social problems. Drinking can cancel out the hard work you put into training and physical activity. Drinking inhibits sleep which negatively impacts processes necessary for muscle development and recovery, causes dehydration, and increases risk of injury. Alcoholic drinks are a major calorie source for US adults, but provide few nutrients. The body treats alcohol as fat, converting alcohol sugars into fatty acids.To assess your own drinking habits and level of risk, and strategies to stay within low risk guidelines, visit online resources at (link 2) or (link 3)","physical_activity_description":"Weight training may be an unfamiliar form of exercise for many of us.
